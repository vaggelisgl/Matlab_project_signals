# Matlab_project_signals
A matlab project that requires you to input a few audio signals into matlab and analyze them using frequency analysis, poles and zeros, fourier transforms etc. 
and then create a bunch of filters to apply to those audio signals, in order to get some desired effects and analyze them further.
